# Accounting System ‚Äì Presales UI Prototype (Client Presentation Project)

**Note:** This was a presales initiative developed for internal client evaluation purposes. No production code or private data is shared.

## üìã Project Overview

This prototype was part of a presales phase for a modern web-based accounting system. Three different frontend implementations were created to demonstrate varying UI frameworks and development approaches.

My version was built using **Mantine UI** and focused on demonstrating:

- Dashboard-style data presentation
- Intuitive form flows with validation
- Responsive table and chart components

The presales phase lasted approximately **1 month**, with the goal of providing the client with multiple alternatives for UI/UX direction and stack selection.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role

I was responsible for delivering **one of the three presented frontend variants**, using Mantine and the Vite ecosystem.

Key responsibilities included:

- Designing and implementing 3 interactive views (e.g. dashboard, form, data table)
- Integrating charts, date pickers, and notification flows
- Using **Zod + React Hook Form** for schema-based validation
- Preparing stack documentation to explain **technical tradeoffs**, including development speed, bundle size, and component extensibility
- Demonstrating the stack‚Äôs **developer experience and flexibility**

- Although this was a short presales phase, I communicated regularly with the product team to clarify interaction requirements and with the sales lead to understand client expectations. The work was agile in nature, using lightweight Jira boards for progress tracking. I used Figma mockups as a visual baseline and took initiative in translating high-level goals into interface behavior. Time management was essential here due to the tight delivery timeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Framework & Libraries
- **React 18**
- **Vite** (with TypeScript)
- **Mantine UI** ‚Äì component library, including charts, dates, notifications
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** ‚Äì validation and form handling
- **TanStack Query** ‚Äì API interaction (mocked in presales phase)

### Visualization
- **Recharts**, **Mantine Charts** ‚Äì charts and KPI displays
- **TanStack Table** ‚Äì data tables with sorting and pagination

### Tooling
- **Vitest**, **Testing Library** ‚Äì test setup (no extensive tests configured for prototype)
- **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **SVGO**, **vite-plugin-svgr**
- **React Router DOM**, **Day.js**, **clsx**

## üîç Outcome

- Delivered a working prototype that showcased UI responsiveness, form handling, and dynamic table rendering
- Supported internal discussions with a comparative review of stack pros/cons
- Helped inform the client‚Äôs direction on stack selection and visual design language
