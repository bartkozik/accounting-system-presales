# Accounting System – Presales UI Prototype (Client Presentation Project)

**Note:** This was a presales initiative developed for internal client evaluation purposes. No production code or private data is shared.

## 📋 Project Overview

This prototype was part of a presales phase for a modern web-based accounting system. Three different frontend implementations were created to demonstrate varying UI frameworks and development approaches.

My version was built using **Mantine UI** and focused on demonstrating:

- Dashboard-style data presentation
- Intuitive form flows with validation
- Responsive table and chart components

The presales phase lasted approximately **1 month**, with the goal of providing the client with multiple alternatives for UI/UX direction and stack selection.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I was responsible for delivering **one of the three presented frontend variants**, using Mantine and the Vite ecosystem.

Key responsibilities included:

- Designing and implementing 3 interactive views (e.g. dashboard, form, data table)
- Integrating charts, date pickers, and notification flows
- Using **Zod + React Hook Form** for schema-based validation
- Preparing stack documentation to explain **technical tradeoffs**, including development speed, bundle size, and component extensibility
- Demonstrating the stack’s **developer experience and flexibility**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Framework & Libraries
- **React 18**
- **Vite** (with TypeScript)
- **Mantine UI** – component library, including charts, dates, notifications
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** – validation and form handling
- **TanStack Query** – API interaction (mocked in presales phase)

### Visualization
- **Recharts**, **Mantine Charts** – charts and KPI displays
- **TanStack Table** – data tables with sorting and pagination

### Tooling
- **Vitest**, **Testing Library** – test setup (no extensive tests configured for prototype)
- **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **SVGO**, **vite-plugin-svgr**
- **React Router DOM**, **Day.js**, **clsx**

## 🔍 Outcome

- Delivered a working prototype that showcased UI responsiveness, form handling, and dynamic table rendering
- Supported internal discussions with a comparative review of stack pros/cons
- Helped inform the client’s direction on stack selection and visual design language
